# N-Queens Problem Solver (Python)

This repository contains a Python implementation of the N-Queens Problem, a classic algorithmic challenge. It uses a backtracking algorithm to place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. The program displays each solution in a clear chessboard format and allows adjusting the board size.

## Objectives
- Implement a backtracking algorithm to find all valid solutions.
- Strengthen recursion, problem-solving, and algorithm design skills.
- Provide readable chessboard-style output.
- Write modular and reusable Python code.

---


## Tasks Completed
- Developed the backtracking-based N-Queens solver.
- Validates queen positions to avoid conflicts.
- Generates all valid solutions for any N.
- Displays each solution in ASCII chessboard format.
- Supports changing board size easily.
